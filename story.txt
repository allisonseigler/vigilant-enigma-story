Beewitched:
Once upon a time, there was a bee named Barry Botter.  But this bee was no ordinary bee, oh no.  You see, Barry was a witch bee.
He could do magic and, like, other stuff, probably.  He didn't know he was a witch until his twefth birthday, which was already
odd because bees usually only live a few months.  On his twelfth birthday, a weird giant human came to his beehive and said, 
"Yer a witch, Barry."  He then attended witch school in Portugal, his home.  But things were about to take a turn for the worse 
when...
