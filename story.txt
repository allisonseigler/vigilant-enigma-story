Beewitched:
Once upon a time, there was a bee named Barry Botter.  But this bee was no ordinary bee, oh no.  You see, Barry was a witch bee.
He could do magic and, like, other stuff, probably.  He didn't know he was a witch until his twelfth birthday, which was already
odd because bees usually only live a few months.  On his twelfth birthday, a weird giant human came to his beehive and said, 
"Yer a witch, Barry."  He then attended witch school in Portugal, his home.  But things were about to take a turn for the worse 
when...
he was confronted by an angry looking bee named Borris. Borris was unlike all the other bees at school. Borris was actually the top of his class and hated anyone and everyone who was worse than him, especially Barry. Barry was always trying to one up him and get in his way and Borris was finally sick of it. Borris went up to Barry and shoved him down. He started screaming at Barry as a circle formed around the two bees. Barry was completely paralyzed in shock of what had just happened and all he could focus on was the chanting from the other bees of "fight, fight, fight!" So finally, Barry took all he could muster, got up, walked towards Borris, and...

"Stop, Botter." Suddenly a thin man with sallow skin and a large, hooked nose came. Barry knew his name, Professor Snabee. He could feel Snabee's strong disgust against him. "You will lose 50 points for your recklessness, Mr.Botter." Snabee said...

"Run Barry, Run!!" said Snabee, else I will cut 1000 points from your house. Barry got scared and ran and studied really hard and became successful till he got a position above Snabee and ruled over him.
